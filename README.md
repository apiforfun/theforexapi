# the foreign exchange rates by The Forex API

theforexapi is a free API for present and historical foreign exchange rates. We developed this service by reading public data from [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/euro_reference_exchange_rates/html/index.en.html).

**Note**: The reference rates are usually updated around 16:00 CET on every working day.
